# Orchestrator Configure-er App

This is the companion App for configuring the [orchestrator (core)](../core) -- registering user, de-registering the user, updating user information, etc.

> You can also use the API of the orchestrator core if really want to.

It is built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/).

## Set up

1. Install dependencies: `npm i`

2. Run the development server: `npm run dev`

3. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) from your browser

Note: You'll need a working [orchestrator core](../core) instance running somewhere for this App to be useful.
